# Vericode Packager

This is a minumal script to be used in place of Vericode Mobile Application Packager for iOS where it can't be easily used such as a CI or build step. 
This script is a work in progress and should not be used at this time.
  
When complete you will need to provide your own credentials to upload to vericode. More documentation on that to come.
